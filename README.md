# Rail Grind Tutorial

===

This repo is just the code from a video I made about grinding rails made from Unity's spline tool in Unity.

You need the following packages:
* Splines
* Input System
I also have Cinemachine for this project, but you might not need it for you own.

The project scene consists of a basic character controller that you can move with WASD, some rails to grind, and some colliders on the outer walls to keep you in-bounds.
